# Twitter Database

This project involves creating a search engine to retrieve tweets based on user input. To optimize data storage and access, two types of datastores are used: relational and non-relational. Relational datastores, managed by a relational database management system (RDBMS), are suitable for structured data with fixed schemas, enabling efficient querying and processing. Non-relational datastores, more flexible and accommodating of unstructured data, store tweets in a versatile format.

### STORAGE
MongoDB was used to store the tweets data and Postgres was used to store users data.

The main focus is developing the search engine. It uses both types of datastores to store tweet data, providing structured storage for user data and flexible storage for tweets. Caching techniques are crucial for performance enhancement. Dynamic caching stores frequently accessed data in a cache, reducing query time and enhancing data search efficiency. This project's objective is a fully functional search engine with optimal tweet retrieval and a quality user experience.
