# Twitter Database

This project focuses on implementing relational and non-relational datastores to store tweet streams and creating a search engine for retrieving tweets based on user input. The goal is to optimize data search efficiency through dynamic caching techniques, ensuring quick and accurate retrieval of Twitter data and an enhanced user experience.
MongoDB was used to store the tweets data and Postgres was used to store users data.
